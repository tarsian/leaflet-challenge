# Leaflet Challenge - Visualizing Earthquake Data

## Overview
This project utilizes Leaflet.js to create interactive maps that visualize earthquake data from the USGS and tectonic plates data to explore the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. The project is divided into two parts:

- **Part 1**: Visualize earthquake data using Leaflet. This part focuses on plotting earthquakes on a map based on their longitude, latitude, magnitude, and depth.
- **Part 2** (Optional): Enhance the visualization by adding a dataset for tectonic plates and providing multiple map layers that users can toggle between.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Leaflet.js
- USGS GeoJSON Data
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript
- An understanding of Leaflet.js is helpful but not required

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leaflet-challenge.git
2. Navigate to the directory:
  ```bash
  cd leaflet-challenge

## Usage
Open the index.html file in your browser to view the project. Use the layer controls to toggle between different datasets and base maps.

Part 1: Earthquake Visualization
Data Source: Earthquake data is fetched from the USGS GeoJSON Feed.
Features:
Earthquakes are represented as circles, with size indicating magnitude and color indicating depth.
Click on any earthquake marker to view details about the earthquake.
Part 2: Tectonic Plates and Additional Data
Data Source: Tectonic plates data is fetched from Fraxen's tectonic plates GitHub repository.
Features:
Tectonic plates are visualized using lines on the map.
Additional base maps are available for different viewing preferences.
Separate overlays for earthquakes and tectonic plates that can be toggled on and off.
Deployment
The project can be deployed on any static server or platforms like GitHub Pages.
